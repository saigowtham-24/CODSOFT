# 🔐 Basic Password Generator in Python

This project is part of my **CodSoft Internship**, showcasing practical Python skills through a secure password generator. It allows users to specify the desired password length and generates a strong, random password using a mix of letters, digits, and special characters. The script emphasizes input validation and modular design, making it easy to extend with future features.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ User-defined password length
- 🔀 Randomized character selection from:
  - 🔡 Uppercase and lowercase letters
  - 🔢 Digits (`0-9`)
  - 🔣 Special characters (`!@#$%^&*`, etc.)
- ⚠️ Input validation for:
  - Minimum length (≥ 4 characters)
  - Numeric input only

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 📦 Built-in libraries:
  - `random` — for secure random selection
  - `string` — for character sets

---

## ▶️ How It Works

1. 🧑‍💻 **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter the desired password length.
2. 🛡️ **Validation**: Ensures the input is a valid number and meets the minimum length requirement.
3. 🎲 **Password Generation**: Randomly selects characters from a secure pool.
4. 📤 **Output**: Displays the generated password on the screen.

## 📦 Installation

No external dependencies required.
